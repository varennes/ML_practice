Machine Learning practice projects

## List of projects

- `sklearn_digits_01.ipynb`
    - Used a SVM with a gaussian kernel to predict values of handwritten digits. Iterated over several different kernels to find optimal classifier parameters.
- `sklearn_iris_01.ipynb`
    - Used a K-nearest neighbor classifier to predict the species of various iris flower samples.

- `wip` directory
    - Contains projects that are a work in progress.
